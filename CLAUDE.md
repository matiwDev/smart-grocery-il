# Smart Grocery IL — Claude Code Context

## What this project is
A mobile-first, real-time grocery price comparison app for the Israeli market.
Users build a shopping basket, the app compares total cost across 4 supermarket chains
(Shufersal, Rami Levy, Victory, Yohananof), and routes them to the cheapest nearby branch.

## Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Realtime + Auth)
- **Auth:** Supabase OTP (email + phone), profiles auto-created via DB trigger
- **Styling:** 4 switchable color palettes via CSS variables, RTL/LTR Hebrew/English toggle
- **Animation:** motion (framer-motion v12)
- **Map:** react-leaflet + leaflet (client-only, dynamically imported — see gotchas)

## Environment variables
Located at `.env.local` (gitignored). If missing, run: `npm run env:link`
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
RESEND_API_KEY=
```
`RESEND_API_KEY` is only used as the custom SMTP credential configured in the
Supabase dashboard (Auth → Emails → SMTP Settings) — the app code never reads
it directly. See "Custom SMTP (Resend)" below for the dashboard values.

## Database schema (key tables)
```sql
chains         — id (text PK), name_he, name_en, color_hex
products       — id (uuid), barcode (unique), name_he, name_en, category
branches       — id, chain_id, name_he, name_en, city_he, city_en, lat, lng, is_active
price_history  — id, product_id, chain_id, branch_id, price, captured_at, source
latest_prices  — MATERIALIZED VIEW: latest price per (product_id, chain_id)
profiles       — id (= auth.users.id), nickname, phone_number, avatar_url, selected_skin
households     — id, name, invite_code (unique, nullable — migration 003, NOT YET APPLIED)
household_members — household_id, user_id, role
baskets        — id, user_id, household_id, name, is_archived
basket_items   — id, basket_id, product_id, product_name, quantity_value
messages       — id, user_id, nickname, message_text, created_at
price_alerts   — id, product_id, user_id, target_price, chain_id, is_active
                 (migration 002, NOT YET APPLIED — see below)
```

RPC functions (migration 003, NOT YET APPLIED):
```
generate_invite_code()             — internal helper, 6-char alphanumeric code
get_or_create_own_household()      — lazily creates the caller's household + invite
                                      code on first call, returns (id, name, invite_code)
join_household_by_code(code text)  — inserts a household_members row for the caller
                                      into the household matching invite_code
```

## Seeded data
- 18 real Israeli products with Hebrew + English names and real barcodes
- 4 chains: shufersal, rami_levy, victory, yohananof
- 8 branches across Gush Dan area with real coordinates
- 72 price rows (18 products × 4 chains) with realistic ILS prices
- latest_prices materialized view populated

## Custom SMTP (Resend)
Supabase's built-in email service has a very low rate limit (a few emails/hour),
which breaks OTP testing. Fix: configure Resend as custom SMTP.

Manual steps in Supabase Dashboard → Project Settings → Auth → SMTP Settings:
```
Enable Custom SMTP: ON
Sender email:        onboarding@resend.dev   (or a verified domain sender)
Sender name:         Smart Grocery IL
Host:                smtp.resend.com
Port:                465
Username:             resend
Password:             <the RESEND_API_KEY value>
Minimum interval between emails: lower from default if still testing OTP a lot
```
`RESEND_API_KEY` only needs to live in `.env.local` as a reference for whoever
is pasting it into the dashboard — the running app does not call Resend directly.

## RLS rules
- products, chains, branches, price_history, latest_prices: public SELECT (authenticated + anon)
- baskets, basket_items: user owns their own rows (auth.uid() = user_id)
- profiles: user owns their own row
- price writes: service_role only
- **Gotcha:** don't write to `profiles` right after `supabase.auth.signUp()`. When email
  confirmation is required, `signUp()` returns `session: null`, so the anon client has no
  JWT yet and `auth.uid()` is null — the profiles RLS check silently rejects the insert.
  Create/upsert the profile row only after a real session exists (i.e. after OTP
  verification, or immediately if auto-confirm is on and `signUp()` already returned a
  session). See `components/AuthModal.tsx`'s `handleVerify`.

## Dev-mode auth bypass
`AuthModal.tsx` shows a "Dev Login" button when `NODE_ENV=development`. It calls
`POST /api/dev/login`, which get-or-creates a fixed test account
(`dev@smartgrocery.local`) via `supabase.auth.admin.createUser` with
`email_confirm: true`, upserts its `profiles` row, and returns credentials for the
client to call `signInWithPassword` with. No email is ever sent by this path, and the
route 404s outside development — use this instead of real signups when testing basket/
profile/UI flows locally.

## Current roadmap phase
**Phase 0 complete** — schema, seed data, API routes in place.

**Phase 1 complete:**
- [x] Fixed product search returning empty results — root cause was a corrupted
      SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (stray leading char) in the linked env file, plus
      .env.local having been a symlink instead of a real file
- [x] /api/products/search?q=חלב returns products with prices per chain
- [x] /api/prices/compare returns sorted chain totals + cheapest_chain + max_savings
- [x] basket_items.product_id wired to real products.id on add
- [x] Basket items + prices rehydrate into UI state on login
- [x] Real Leaflet map (react-leaflet) replacing the placeholder, pins colored by
      chain, Waze deep links, "Navigate to cheapest" pre-selects that chain's branches
- [x] Search autocomplete loading skeleton
- [x] 44×44px touch target audit (header had two undersized buttons, now fixed)
- [x] Auth flow tested end-to-end incl. profile row + auto-created basket

**Phase 2 in progress:**
- [x] Color/rank map pins by this basket's cost at that branch (green/amber/red via
      `/api/prices/compare` comparison data), basket total shown in the marker popup
- [x] Price alerts: bell icon per basket item persists a row to `price_alerts`
      (no notification delivery yet — persistence only). **Needs migration
      `002_price_alerts.sql` applied via the Supabase SQL Editor before it works.**
- [x] Household invite flow in Profile view: generate/copy a 6-char invite code,
      join by code. **Needs migration `003_household_invite.sql` applied via the
      Supabase SQL Editor before it works** (adds `households.invite_code` +
      the `get_or_create_own_household`/`join_household_by_code` RPCs).
- [ ] Wire CHAT view to the `messages` table (currently local mock state only)
- [ ] Regenerate `supabase/schema.sql` (or a migration) so it matches the live DB
- [ ] Either wire `app/api/baskets/sync/route.ts` into the frontend or remove it —
      it's currently unused dead code

## Coding conventions
- All components: functional, TypeScript strict
- API routes: always use `lib/supabaseServer.ts` (service role), never the anon client
- Tailwind only for styling — no inline style except CSS variable overrides
- Hebrew is the primary language; English is secondary
- Minimum touch target: 44×44px on all interactive elements
- `@/*` path alias resolves to project root

## How to run
```bash
npm run dev        # Start dev server on localhost:3000
npm run build      # Production build
npm run lint       # ESLint check
npm run env:link   # Restore .env.local from ~/.config/smartgrocery/.env.local
```

## How to reset the database
`supabase/schema.sql` is stale and does NOT reproduce the full live schema (see
"Repo structure" above) — running it alone will not recreate products, chains,
branches, price_history, or latest_prices. Until a current dump/migration
exists, reset via the Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor using the live schema as
reference, then refresh the materialized view:
```sql
SELECT refresh_latest_prices();
```

## Applying migrations
There is no `supabase` CLI or direct Postgres connection configured for this
repo (no `SUPABASE_DB_URL`, no linked project) — `supabase/migrations/*.sql`
files are written here but must be pasted into the Supabase Dashboard SQL
Editor by hand to actually take effect. As of this writing, `002_price_alerts.sql`
and `003_household_invite.sql` are unapplied; the corresponding app features
(price alert bell, household invite/join) are wired correctly end-to-end but
will fail with PostgREST "not found" errors (PGRST205/PGRST202) until those
are run.

## Known issues / gotchas
- latest_prices is a materialized view — after any price_history insert, call refresh_latest_prices()
- SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY must be in .env.local (not just the anon key) for API routes to work
- Next.js does NOT follow symlinks for .env.local — always write the file directly
- The `households` RLS policy must be defined AFTER `household_members` table exists
- Tailwind 4 uses @tailwindcss/postcss — do not add a tailwind.config.js, it's not needed
- motion is imported from 'motion/react', not 'framer-motion'
- Leaflet needs `window`/`document` at import time — `BranchLeafletMap` is loaded via
  `next/dynamic(..., { ssr: false })` from `BranchMapContainer`; don't import react-leaflet
  directly into a component that can render server-side
- If you edit a hook's dependency array while the dev server is running, Fast Refresh can
  throw a spurious "final argument passed to useEffect changed size between renders" error.
  It's not a real bug — restart the dev server (or hard-reload) and it clears
- Ad-hoc debug scripts (`node -e "..."` using @supabase/supabase-js) fail with a
  WebSocket error on Node 20 because realtime-js needs a native WebSocket (Node 22+).
  Either upgrade Node for scripting, or just hit the REST endpoints directly with
  `fetch(...)` + the service-role key instead of instantiating a full client
- The slide-in nav drawer's open/close spring animation (`isDrawerOpen`, damping 25/
  stiffness 200) is slow to settle — automated clicks on drawer items can silently
  land on stale coordinates mid-animation. Wait ~3-4s after opening it before clicking
  a nav item, or drive it in code instead of through the browser
- The dev server's `.next` cache can get into a bad state after enough hot-reloads in
  one session — API routes start throwing `ENOENT ... .next/server/app/api/.../route.js`
  (500s) even though the route compiles fine. Fix: stop the server, `rm -rf .next`,
  restart — don't chase it as an app bug
- To verify a Supabase RPC/table is wired correctly without going through the UI (e.g. when
  navigation is being flaky, or before a migration has been applied): read the session token
  from `localStorage["sb-<project-ref>-auth-token"].access_token` and POST directly to
  `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/rest/v1/rpc/<fn>` with `apikey`/`Authorization` headers
  set from the anon key + that token. A `PGRST202`/`PGRST205` response confirms the call
  reached PostgREST with the right function/table name and params — it's just missing the
  migration — as opposed to a bug in the client code
